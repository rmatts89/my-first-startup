		<div><p>Hello Everyone, and welcome to the About Me portion of my website.  Well to start off, my father, at the time, was enlisted in the US Navy.  My mother was and still is a nurse.  Though I have strong East Coast roots, I spent most of my childhood and now adulthood in beautiful Southern California.  Truly blessed with having grown up here, I have been extremely spoiled as far as weather and beautiful women.  Not to mentione the weed, LOL just playing.  </p></div>
		<div><p>Welcome everyone, i hope you're all having an amazing and positive day!  Life is too short for the negativity I say!  You have to enjoy life!  You get ffrom it what you put in to it. I thought I would take this opportunity to give you a peak into who Rob is.  First and foremost, I am a dad to a very beautiful, smart and just overall AMAZING little girl.  I love you baby girl, never limit yourself as to what you can accomplish!  The world is yours for the taking.  I like to travel to new places and experience new cultures and ways of life.  Human behavior has always been one of my biggest curiosities, from how we interact with one another to how we dress, how we act toward some people versus others.  It all fascinates me very much.  I am a poker player as well.  I love the game very much, and i don't see myself slowing down or stopping any time soon!  I have been playing poker since I was about 13.  That's about the time my brother, Chris, started getting into the game.  I remeber always having home games at my house, ahhh, the good times!</p></div><div><p>I was born on the east coast of the United States, New Jersey, to be exact.  I have been fortunate enough to spend most of my life in beautiful California.  We moved here when I was about 4 or 5.  First to San Diego's Mira Mesa area, and then shortly after to  Temecula, where I have spent a majority of my life.  It was a very small town when i first arrived on the scene in the scene in Temecula.  We are most known in the general local area for our beautiful wineries, our promenade mall and for Pechanga Resort and Casino.  The city has grown tremendously in the almost 20 years that I have been here, multiplying it's population by about 8, from roughly 15,000 to current numbers being 112,000+.</p></div><div><p>Anyone who knows me can tell you, I'm not a cocky or arrogent person by any means.  I like to consider myself very humble, and down to earth.  Laid back, but very driven at the same time.  And I have recently been giving serious thought into starting a Be Kind Initiative, dedicated to just getting myself out there and just talking about life experience and how the choices and actions we make affect our lives.  About the importance of paying it forward and how being kind to just one person a day will change your life for the better.  Michael Jackson said in one of his songs, "If you want to make the world a better place, then take a look at yourself and make a change"!  America as a whole used to be a lot more family oriented and just all-around more neighborly and kind.  We looked out for one another.  We made sure that everyone was taken care of.  And that is why I wanted to start an initiative whose soul purpose and end goal was to help to brins some humanity back into this beautiful and <em> amazing</em> country that I am proud to say I come from.  Let us, the real American Citeznes, the hard working, honest and kind-hearted beautiful Americans, make our country great once again!</p></div><div id="div1"><p>I was extremely skeptical when I first heard of Udemy.  I thought to myself, "There is <strong>NO WAY</strong> that I can legitimately change my life for what they were asking for, price wise...There's literally <strong>NO WAY</strong>".  I was a Lyft driver at that stage in my life.  I worked mostly in Los Angeles, and I would pick up people that happened to work in the tech and computer science field, and when I would bring up the site to them, I <em>usually</em> would get very positive feedback about it.  And not once did a single person bash or talk bad about the site.  So I did a little more research and dug through countless customer reviews and user feedback.  And review after raview, most everyone had nothing but incredibly positive feedback about the programs and the site in general.  They all said their instructors did a really good job of breaking down the material and made it fun and easy to learn.</p>
