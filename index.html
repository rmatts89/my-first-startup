You have forever changed my life for the better, and I <em>cannot thank you enough</em>.  Every sinlge time I interacted with you personally, you were always very polite and respectful.  You made me feel like my opinion mattered, and you <em>ALWAYS</em> have an amazingly positive attitude and outlook on life!  It has truly been a pleasure and a privelage to have learned so much from you.</p></li>

		<div id="div2"><li><p>Secondly, I would like to thank my father, <strong>Christopher</strong>, for reccomending this web site and career path for me.  You also have changed my life for the better <em>more than you know</em>.  "The things you do affect other people!".  That was my father's favorite quote when I was growing up.  I cannot tell you how many times I heard that man say that phrase.  That and "Did you read the manual?".  Hahaha, I never really appreciated how smart and knowledgeable my dad was when I was a little kid.  I know that you always did the best that you could, and for what it is worth, I am sorry that I made it harder than it needed to be.  You have always tried finding ways to keep me motivated and on track, and I just want to say thank you for always trying to push me and drive me.  I didn't then, but I do appreciate your efforts now!  This is honestly really ironic and funny, I used to always see my dad reading books just like the course I am taking now.</p></li></div>
		<div id="div3"><img src="https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/420910_10150711837623436_1358410335_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&oh=2e361b39972c3918ea2106d414f2eeea&oe=5D3FBF3C" width="150" height="120"></div>
		<li><p>Third,  but most of all, I want to thank my mother, <strong>Maryann</strong> for always supporting my dreams and my passions and allowing me to grow into the person I am today!  No word can do jsutice to the sacrifice and love you have showed for your family!!!  You are the best mother any son could ask for, and I hope that you get to enjoy the this chapter in your life and find happiness and love in your retirement!  I know that I wasn't the easiest son to raise, and I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for never giving up on me and always supporting my dreams!  I love you more than words will ever describe.</p></li></ul>

		<li><p>And lastly, but not least by any means, I want to thank my big brother, also <strong>Christopher</storng>.  I know that we never really got a chance to grow close together, and I know that I have been a contributor to that fact.  I know that I wasnt always the best little brother, and we always seem to butt heads.  I admit and take some of the responsibility, and for that, I am sorry!  I have never told you this, but I have always looked up to you.  You never let the negativity and burden of life get in your way to success and happiness, and I respect and admire that so much about you.  You have drive, dedication and passion that is unmatched by anyone, and that is why you got yourself into and graduated from one of the best schools this fine nation of ours has to offer.  Im so proud of the man you have grown into, I could not mean that more my brother!  I wish you nothing but the absolute best success in life, may you find your happiness my frined <3!</p></li>
